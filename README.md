OpenVPN-PHP-Gui
=======================

MIT License - See LICENSE.txt

OpenVPN-PHP-Gui is a php script to manage your openvpn installation.  
This is geared for beginners that don't feel confortable on the command line.


IMPORTANT:
This uses phpseclib to run terminal commands, and thus requires root password for openvpn setup and management

Features:

* Complete initial configuration of OpenVPN - buggy, but works
* View and Manage Certificates - partially working 
* Edit your openvpn.conf file
* Generate and send/download certificate bundles - partially working


If running a Debian based-system (apt-get based), the script will run apt-get install openvpn for you.

Recommended packages to install for Debian Systems:

* lsb-release: For getting name and version of release
* sudo:  For the installer php script
